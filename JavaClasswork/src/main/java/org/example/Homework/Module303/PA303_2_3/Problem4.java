//Write a program that declares three int variables: x, y, and z. Assign 7 to x and 17 to y.
// Write a comment that indicates what you predict will be the result of the bitwise and operation on x and y.
// Now use the bitwise AND (&) operator to derive the decimal and binary values, and assign the result to z.

//Now, with the preceding values, use the bitwise and operator to calculate the “or” value between x and y.
// As before, write a comment that indicates what you predict the values to be before printing them out.
