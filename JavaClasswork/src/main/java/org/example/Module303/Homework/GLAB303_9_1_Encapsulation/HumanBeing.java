//Encapsulation refers to hiding the class variable from other classes and giving access to them
// only through methods (setters and getters).
//Encapsulation in Java means binding the data (variables) with the code (methods â€“ setters and getters).

//Class Variables (in the example: height, weight, and bmi) are declared private; hence, they are
// not visible to other classes.
//For each variable, there is a setter and getter method, which sets a value to the variable
// and gets the variable's value, respectively.
//Example: For variable height, setter method is setHeight() and getter method is getHeight().
//Setter and Getter methods are public; hence, they are visible to other classes.
