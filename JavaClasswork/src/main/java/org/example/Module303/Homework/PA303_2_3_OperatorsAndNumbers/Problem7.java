//Write a program that declares two integer variables: x, and y, and then assigns 5 to x and 8 to y.
// Create another variable sum and assign the value of ++x added to y, and print the result.
// Notice the value of the sum (should be 14). Now change the increment operator to postfix (x++)
// and re-run the program. Notice what the value of the sum is. The first configuration incremented
// x, and then calculated the sum, while the second configuration calculated the sum, and then incremented x.
