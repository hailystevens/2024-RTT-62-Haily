        //Task 4: Write a program that creates an integer array with 5 elements (i.e., numbers). The numbers can be any integers.  Print out the value at the first index and the last index using length - 1 as the index. Now try printing the value at index = length (e.g., myArray[myArray.length] ).  Notice the type of exception which is produced. Now try to assign a value to the array index 5. You should get the same type of exception.
